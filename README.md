# Dog-adoptions

This is a final React project I developed with a team of two other Frontend engineers at the end of our Bootcamp in Infoshare Academy. 
This is a webpage for people looking for a dog to adopt and for shelters to promote their pupils. We prepared an option to log in for a regular person - who can add up to 3 dogs to the list and login for an organization - that can add an unlimited number of dogs. The goal is to match users with homeless dogs. 
The user who is not logged in can still browse the full list of the dogs and make a reservation. This process is easier with an account. Data, authorization, and authentication are provided through Firebase. 
My main focus was to prepare a home page with all the dogs on the show and make a helpful form that is available under the "Pytania pomocnicze" button. The list is showing filtered results after each choice and helpful popups appear on the hover of every option.
My secondary focus was to prepare beautiful search forms on every page and preparation of the login/register page. 
My friend prepared login/registration logic and a page for the user. User can see, edit, and delete dogs that they added to their account's page. Information about people who made reservations on the given dogs is also available from a personal client panel.
